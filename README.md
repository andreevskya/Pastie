Simple educational project where I teach myself Spring.
The project is a simple web service written in Java, Spring and Hibernate to share text snippets. Work in progress.

How to build (Maven):

First you need modified Jygments package from <a href="https://github.com/andreevskya/jygments">here</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tliron/jygments">tliron</a> who ported Pygments to Java).
Build it and install to the project as local dependency.
Then build the project.
